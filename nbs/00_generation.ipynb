    "It is worth noting that a Jupyter Notebook runs in the browser, and is therefore subject to the laws of web development. Moreover, a couple of handy \"magic methods\" `%%html` and `%%js` can be placed at the start of a code cell to run HTML or JavaScript. Thanks to it, we can create a new `div` and use a simple prebundled script using [IFC.js](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/) to render our brand new IFC on it. You may have a look at the simple JS script [here](https://github.com/cvillagrasa/IfcOpenHouse/blob/master/viz/nb_viz.js)."
